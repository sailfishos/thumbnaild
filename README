thumbnaild - a simple thumbnail generator service

This service differs from tumbler, which implements a service aligned with the
freedesktop.org Thumbnail management guidelines ( https://specifications.freedesktop.org/thumbnail-spec/thumbnail-spec-latest.html )
by aiming to share thumbnails with GUI applications using the nemo-qml-plugin-thumbnailer
thumbnail generation logic.
